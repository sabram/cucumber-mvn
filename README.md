My first stab at using Cucumber, the BDD (behavior-driven development) style tool for running automated acceptance tests.
Specifically, I am using Cucumber-JVM, the Java implementation of Cucumber (the original is written in Ruby).

My example is based on https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-java-skeleton, which is basically the Cucumber JVM version of Hello World.
As well as this example (https://thomassundberg.wordpress.com/2012/09/28/test-drive-an-implementation-using-an-executable-specification-revisited/#more-1216) from Thomas Sundberg.
